Hello teacher. I am from Japan. I'm in a forth semester and learning computer programming
My hobby is playing volleyball. I play 5 days a week.
I play volleyball after school on thursday
I am looking for job but I did not find for now. 
Because I do not have any exparience about computer programming
It's hard for me. However I will do my best. I will make my project or website.
Also I want to make a connection with Canadian. It's easy to get a job here.
Anyway, I will do my best for exam now.
